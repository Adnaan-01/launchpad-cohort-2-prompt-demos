# launchpad-cohort-2-prompt-demos

Dear Learners,

This repo is dedicated to showcasing your prompting skills. Your task is to get a basic understanding of Prompt Engineering and then reflect on your learning by picking any of the use cases/techniques mentioned in the course with your own creative use case.

Hence,

1.  Clone this repository
2.  Create a branch with your github id and checkout
3.  Create folder with your github id
4.  Under that folder create a markdown file and add your first creative prompt, alongwith answer you got from your favorite llm. You will create two headings : (1) Prompt, (2) LLM Response
5.  Once done, commit the code and raise the pull request to merge your branch into main branch.

## Creative Prompt Ideas

Here are some ideas to inspire your creative prompts:

1. **Role-based Prompting**: Create a prompt where the LLM assumes a specific role (historian, scientist, chef, etc.) to provide specialized knowledge.

2. **Chain-of-Thought**: Design a prompt that guides the LLM through a step-by-step reasoning process to solve a complex problem.

3. **Few-Shot Learning**: Provide a few examples within your prompt to help the LLM understand the pattern you want it to follow.

4. **Persona Adaptation**: Ask the LLM to communicate in the style of a famous person, character, or specific demographic.

5. **Creative Writing**: Challenge the LLM to generate a story, poem, or script with specific constraints or themes.

6. **Ethical Dilemma Analysis**: Present a moral or ethical dilemma and ask for a balanced analysis of different perspectives.

7. **Educational Content**: Create prompts that transform complex topics into easy-to-understand explanations for specific audiences.

8. **System Design**: Ask the LLM to outline the architecture or components of a theoretical system or product.

9. **Comparative Analysis**: Request a comparison between different concepts, technologies, or approaches.

10. **Data Interpretation**: Provide a scenario with information and ask the LLM to extract insights or make recommendations.

11. **Summarization**: Create a prompt that asks the LLM to condense lengthy content while preserving key information and main points.

12. **Inferring**: Design a prompt that requires the LLM to draw conclusions or make predictions based on incomplete information.

13. **Transforming**: Challenge the LLM to convert content from one format to another (e.g., technical document to simple explanation, bullet points to narrative, code to pseudocode, language translation, etc.).

14. **Expanding**: Provide a brief concept or outline and ask the LLM to develop it into a comprehensive piece with additional details and examples.

15. **Named Entity Extraction**: Create a prompt that asks the LLM to identify and extract specific types of information (people, organizations, locations, dates, etc.) from a given text.

16. **Generation of Structured Output**: Design a prompt that instructs the LLM to produce responses in a specific format (JSON, XML, CSV, tables, etc.) to ensure consistent, parseable, and machine-readable output.

Remember to document both your prompt and the LLM's response in your submission!
