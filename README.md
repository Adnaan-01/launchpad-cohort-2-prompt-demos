# launchpad-cohort-2-prompt-demos

Dear Learners,

This repo is dedicated to showcasing your prompting skills. Your task is to get a basic understanding of Prompt Engineering and then reflect on your learning by picking any of the use cases/techniques mentioned in the course with your own creative use case.

Hence,

1.  Clone this repository
2.  Create a branch with your github id and checkout
3.  Create folder with your github id
4.  Under that folder create a markdown file and add your first creative prompt, alongwith answer you got from your favorite llm. You will create two headings : (1) Prompt, (2) LLM Response
5.  Once done, commit the code and raise the pull request to merge your branch into main branch.
