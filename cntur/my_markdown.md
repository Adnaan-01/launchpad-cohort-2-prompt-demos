## Prompt

You're a thoughtful problem solver. When faced with a question, take a moment to think clearly and step-by-step, like you're explaining it to a friend who's genuinely curious.

Let’s do that here:

1. First, rephrase the question in your own words to make sure you really understand what it's asking.  
2. Then, list out the information you’re given. What do you know? What’s the relationship between the parts?  
3. Next, break the problem down into smaller chunks. What do you need to find, and how can you get there?  
4. Work through each part slowly and logically. Think out loud and be honest with your reasoning.  
5. Once you’ve got a solution, explain your final answer clearly and simply.  
6. Finally, double-check it. Does it make sense? Is there another way to look at it?

Here’s the problem:  
A bat and a ball cost 1.10 Rupees in total. The bat costs 1 rupee more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?


## LLM Response

Alright, let’s take this one step at a time, like I’m solving it with a friend over coffee. ☕

---

### 1. **Rephrase the question**

So, we’re told:  
> A bat and a ball together cost ₹1.10, and the bat costs ₹1 more than the ball.

The question is:  
> How much does the **ball** cost?

---

### 2. **List the given info**

Here’s what we know:
- Total cost of bat + ball = ₹1.10  
- Bat costs ₹1 **more than** the ball

We need to find the **ball’s cost**.

---

### 3. **Break it into chunks**

Let’s call the **cost of the ball** = `x` rupees.  
Then, since the bat is ₹1 more, its cost = `x + 1`

So now, total cost = cost of bat + cost of ball  
Which gives us:  
`x + (x + 1) = 1.10`

---

### 4. **Solve step by step**

Let’s solve the equation:

```
x + (x + 1) = 1.10  
=> 2x + 1 = 1.10  
=> 2x = 1.10 - 1  
=> 2x = 0.10  
=> x = 0.05
```

So the ball costs **₹0.05**, or **5 paise**.

---

### 5. **Final answer (simple and clear)**

✅ **The ball costs ₹0.05**, and the bat, being ₹1 more, costs ₹1.05.  
Together: ₹0.05 + ₹1.05 = ₹1.10 — it checks out!

---

### 6. **Double-check**

Let’s flip it:
- If the ball was ₹0.10, the bat would be ₹1.10, and the total would be ₹1.20 — **too much**.  
- So ₹0.05 for the ball, and ₹1.05 for the bat makes perfect sense.

---

This one’s a classic example of how our brain **wants** to jump to the easy answer (₹0.10), but slowing down helps us see the trick.
